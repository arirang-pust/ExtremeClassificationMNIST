This is a demo program that shows the usage of Mine.Data.Readers.MNISTReader, Mine.Engines.Algorithms.GLMClassifierSelectAlgorithm, Mine.Engines.Classifiers.GLMExtremeClassifier libraries.

Mine.Data.Readers.MNISTReader library has calsses and functions to read MNIST dataset.
Mine.Engines.Algorithms.GLMClassifierSelectAlgorithm library has classes and functions to train and validate GLM models.
Mine.Engines.Classifiers.GLMExtremeClassifier library has classes and functions to deal with a GLM model.

Warning :
MNIST dataset (t10k-images.idx3-ubyte, t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte, train-images.idx3-ubyte, train-labels.idx1-ubyte) files should be in the bin/Debug or bin/Release folder.
